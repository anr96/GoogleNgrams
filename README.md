# What Google Books Ngram Corpus reveals about adjective order in English

This simple script iterates through a dictionary of English adjectives (provided by WordNet) and is compared to a various files containing Google bigrams. The end result is a list of adjectival bigrams special to the certain Google bigram file.

With the resulting data, linguistic queries pertaining to adjectival word order and the subjectivity hypothesis can be answered. 

In addition to this gathering of data, my teammate and I conducted a linguistic analysis of the output from FindBigrams. This analysis was then presented at the SFSU Undergraduate Student Research Showcase. The slides for this presentation can be found in the file `UndergraduateShowcaseSlides.pdf`.
